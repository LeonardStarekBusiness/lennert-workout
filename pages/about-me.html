        <h2 class="heading" >My Fitness Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My fitness journey began just <span>2 years ago</span>, but the progress has been incredible. <br> 
            When I first started, I was completely dedicated and went to the gym every single day,<br> pushing my limits, and learning what my body was capable of. <br> 
            Over time, I realized that progress isn't just about doing more, <span>it's about doing it smart</span>. <br> I adjusted my routine to include rest days and now train every other day, allowing my body to <br> recover and grow stronger while avoiding burnout.

        </p>


        <h2 class="heading">My Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
            Nutrition has always been a huge part of my approach. <br>
            I make sure to get plenty of <span>protein from whole foods</span> to fuel my muscles,<br> alongside taking healthy amount of <span>creatine</span> to support performance and recovery. <br> Every meal, every workout, and every rest day is a deliberate step toward building the <span>best version of myself</span>.
        </p>
       
        <h2 class="heading">It's Not just about Getting Stronger</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond just lifting weights, fitness for me is a <span>mindset</span>. <br> 
            It's about discipline, consistency, and <span>celebrating the small victories</span>. <br> 
            along the way. I've learned that growth comes not just from physical strength, <br> 
            but also from mental resilience, patience, and dedication. <br> 
            My goal is to <span>inspire others</span> to embrace their own fitness journey, <br> 
            understand the value of balance, and push themselves to reach new heights, while enjoying the process. <br> 
            With every gain, I'm reminded that hard work, smart choices, and a positive attitude <span>truly pay off</span>.
        </p>
